    <p class = "h">Secure</p>
    <p class = "d">A patient's medical information can potentially be seen by unauthorized parties and can be used for malicious purposes. Medical records are the health history of a patient. The patient should <br> be the owner of the medical data.</p>
    <p class = "h">Decentralized</p>
    <p class = "d">No one person or organization holds your data in their server. By removing a single point of failure, <br>it is next to impossible to lose your data with distributed clusters storing redundant copies of the <br> encrypted medical records.</p>

    <p class = "h">Timeliness</p>
    <p class = "d">Since a patient's medical records are maintained using blockchain, sharing the records is simple and less time-consuming. This approach is fast, in-expensive, and secure.</p>
